## Getting Started

It is very simple to build your project on top of this starter. Just clone the starter in a folder with your project's name. Then remove the git history to be able to initialize your own Git repository. Then install the dependencies with `yarn`.
When the installation has finished you can run the new app with `yarn start`. These are the steps in more detail:

    git clone https://github.com/cutemachine/hyperbulma.git YOUR_PROJECT
    cd YOUR_PROJECT
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m 'Initial version of YOUR_PROJECT'
    yarn
    yarn start
